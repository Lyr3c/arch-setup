Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change free software—to make sure the software is free for
all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  To understand the concept, you should think of "free"
as in "free speech," not as in "free beer."

This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other software that is licensed
by the Free Software Foundation.  (The exact licensing terms may
differ in other cases.)  You can also use this license for your
own software.
